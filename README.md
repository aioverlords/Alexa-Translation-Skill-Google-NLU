Did you know you can earn money by creating a paid Amazon Alexa skill? This video shows you exactly how to do that. In this tutorial we develop and code an Alexa skill that can perform translations using the Alexa developer console. This tutorial will teach you Amazon Alexa Skill development and review the Alexa development kit. We use node.js to write a function that passes the user's dictation to a Google cloud function. We then pass the text to the Google natural languages API to translate. We then pass that translated text to the Google text to speech Wavenet API. This creates an synthetic voice audio rendering of the text spoken in correct dialect. We then pass the MP3 file to the Google cloud storage. Then alexa plays the audio mp3 file in the SSML markup syntax. #alexa​ #nlp​ #wavenet​
